The sign clearly points out that **Manhattan** is doing exceptionally good while **Staten Island** need special attention.\n",
        "2. **Michael** has the highest number of property ownership i.e, 417 followed by **David** i.e., 403 and **Sonder** 327 respectively.\n",
        "3. The room_type distribution can be seen amognst the three i.e., **Entire home** with **52%** share, followed **Private room** by with **45.7%** share and **Shared room** with **2.4%** share.\n",
        "4. We have unique neighbours count accounting for 221 out of which **Williamsburg** has been visited the most **3920** times which is followed by **Bedford-Stuyvesant** with **3714** times.\n",
        "5. **Hillside Hotel** is most popular property amongst customers.**Home away from home** shows second most popular property amongst customers.\n",
        "6. The count chart potrays how price distribution helps in identifying different types of room. For eg. **Affordable property** is pretty huge in number. **Cheap property** is less than affordable but slightly more than **Expensive property**. **Expensive property** is very less in number.\n",
        "7.Another scatterplot depicting the footfall of occupancy in neighbourhood_group based on latitude vs longitude scale. **Brooklyn** and **Manhattan** are the most dense neighborhood_group, followed by **Queens**.\n",
        "8. **Fort Wadsworth** is the **top expensive neighbourhood** based on average price.**Woodrow** is the **second most expensive neighboorhood**.**Concord** is the **cheapest neighbourhood** based on average price.**Second most cheap** neighbourhood is **Castle Hill**.\n",
        "9. To give a clear insight of how each and every series in the data set are linked to each other, how collaborative are the bonds and how loose are they a heatmap has been formulated. The one's with lightest color and indicated with numeric value 1 shares the strongest bond i.e., the series when compared with itself serves the deep collaboration. As the color keeps to darken, the strength of the bonds keeps on deteriorating and the numeric values justifies it all. The series who's joint venture depicts the darkest color and have least numeric value claims to have the weakest bond.\n",
        "10. Eventually a pair plot gives a summarized insight of relationship shared between different type of columns in the dataset. Out of all the columns we have extracted out the ones which are are numeric in nature and add some meaningful data to the analysis. The relationship charts gives a clear highlights of how each column in the dataset share a relation with with other. The peaks in the chart signifies a strong relation when a specified column intersects with itself."
